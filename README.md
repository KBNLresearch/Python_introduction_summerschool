## Welcome to this Python introduction

This introduction has been developed to give relevant basic knowledge about Python and Jupyter Notebooks to the attendees of the KB summerschool. 

In this introduction you will be introduced to:
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Python basics
* The Pandas package

If you open this tutorial in [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/KBNLresearch/Python_introduction_summerschool/HEAD), all notebooks contain interactive cells. We highly encourage you to run all code cells and play around with the content to see what happens. And furthermore, we encourage you to try the exercises! NB: Binder creates a Jupyter Lab enviroment for the interactive Notebooks, so it can take up to a few minutes to load. 

If you have any questions about this introduction, please contact us via mirjam.cuper@kb.nl.
